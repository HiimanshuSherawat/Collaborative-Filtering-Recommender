Collaborative Filtering Recommender System

Collaborative filtering is a family of algorithms where there are multiple ways to find similar users or items and multiple ways to calculate rating based on ratings of similar users.

With user-based collaborative filtering, a visitor to Amazon would be matched with other customers who had similar purchase histories, and those purchase histories would suggest recommendations for the visitor.
